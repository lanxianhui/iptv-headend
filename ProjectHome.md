Project aims to create a complete IPTV headend solution based on multicast IP streaming. Instead of focusing on STB-based networks, it will assume users use a software-based access system incl. VideoLAN VLC. It will include a web EPG service, nPVR service with web scheduling and channel management.

**CTP** stands for Campus Television Platform.

This project is the effect of my senior thesis at the Institute of Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Poland.

The project is not yet ready for production use. However, an early release has been made: you can download the Web interface code and the compiled Java components. The config files have information on how they should be set up, but no detailed installation instructions are available.
